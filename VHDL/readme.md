## VHDL

This is a generic code dump of some of the simple (and not-so-simple) codes using VHDL. It can be a nice way to learn, by trying hands-on.

One of the most important feature of this dump is the __Generic Testbench__. It allows almost seamless deployment into any sequential logic, with minimal change in code. This would, however, require a DUT declaration for defining port-maps etc. To make the compiling and running easy, I have used the scripts `compile_ghdl.sh` and `run_testbench.sh`.
